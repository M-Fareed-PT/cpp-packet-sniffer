# cpp-packet-sniffer
# 🌐 C++ Packet Sniffer & Protocol Analyzer  
A powerful packet sniffer written in modern C++ that captures raw network packets, parses protocol headers, and displays real-time network traffic.

This tool demonstrates advanced network programming and low-level packet analysis similar to tools like tcpdump and Wireshark.

## 🚀 Features
✔ Capture raw packets using sockets  
✔ Parse Ethernet, IPv4, TCP, UDP, ARP, and ICMP headers  
✔ Extract ports, flags, IP addresses, and metadata  
✔ Real-time live traffic monitoring  
✔ Save captured packets to `.pcap` file (optional)  
✔ Modular protocol decoders  
✔ Cross-platform (Linux/Windows)
